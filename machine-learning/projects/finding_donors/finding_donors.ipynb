    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "*Random Forest*\n",
    "* For the application in e-commerce, Random Forest algorithm can be used for predicting whether the customer will like the recommend products, based on the experience of similar customers.\n",
    "* Strengths: \n",
    "    1. Random forest can be applied to both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "    2. Random forest model can be used to identify the feature importance. Thus, it can also be used in feature selection. From selecting a subset of the most important features, this can also be used to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "    3. Instead of building a \"deep\" decision tree, which often time suffers from overfitting. Random Forest prevents overfitting most of the time, by creating random subsets of the features and building smaller trees using these subsets.\n",
    "    4. Random forest model doesn't really require any data preparation.\n",
    "* Weaknesses:\n",
    "    1. When there are not enough trees, the random forest model can still overfit the training data.\n",
    "    2. Ideally, we'd like to train many smaller trees to build the random forest model. However, a large number of trees can lead to a long training time, which is not applicable for real-time prediction.\n",
    "    3. With many trees, random forest model can be difficult to interpret.\n",
    "* Random forest is a good candidate for the problem because clearly it is a classification problem, and random forest model can definitely deal with it. Also, will a set of features that contain both numerical and categorical features, random forest doesn't really require any data preparation/scaling. \n",

    "    3. When the feature dimensions are very large, SVM performs really well espectially when the number of features is larger than the number of samples.\n",

    "* Random Forest classifier is an ensemble algorithm that creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregate the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object. Our data contains multiple features and our goal is to predict if one makes more or less than 50k. This is a two-class target. There are some advantages to use the Random Forest classifier, for example, it can capture non-linear decision boundaries, it is efficient in computation with large datasets, feature selection is integrated in the training and classification processes, trees can acommodate noisy data, and it can handle data with varied distributions. Since the features are a combination of categorical and numerical set, using an ensemble algorithm is a more flexible and suitable method to build the classifier for the data."

    "* Random Forest is a set of decision trees. Suppose you have some fruits (apple, orange, lemon, etc.), and you can tell the fruit name based on its color, weight, taste, etc. For example, if you know the size is small (i.e. less than 50g) and the color is yellow, then it is a lemon. \n",
    "* Decisions trees are branched with these kinds of dichotomous questions used to predict the fruit based on different features (color, size, taste, etc.).\n",
    "* Random Forest uses a lot of decision trees, where each tree is a little different from the others. When we get a new fruit, we take the mahority vote of the decision trees (a forest) to predict what it is.\n",
    "* The reason why each tree is slightly different is because we used random samples of the data to train them, and with only a subset of the features for each tree.\n",
    "* Take the charity model we're building now for example, suppose when we train the first tree, the model may have to pick between the two best classifier, say age and education_num. The next decision branch gets to choose between the 2 best classifiers besides the first one selected. IT will also pick the best split using the selected classifier. \n",
    "* By defualt, the Random Forest model will use the square root of the number of features as the features to look on any given branch. In our case with total 13 features, each decision will be made based on the best of the 4 randomly selected features available.\n",
    "* When we build a model, we don't want to use all the data we have to trian the model. Usually, we will keep a subset of data untouched so that we can use the dataset to test our model. This is what we call training data set and testing data set. \n",
    "* Without knowing the importance of the features, Random Forest Classifier can also be used to identify the importance ranking of the features.\n",

One thing is that I wasn't think about capital-gain/capital-loss are directly related to their income, I assumed they're the capital that don't include in the income. I realized that the top 5 features are all continuous numeric features. It is reasonable that continuous features usually provide more information than the categorical features."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
